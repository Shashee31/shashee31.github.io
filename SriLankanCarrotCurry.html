		<p> Heat the oil in a frying pan over a medium- high heat and add the curry leaves. Once sizzling, add the cumin and mustard seeds.

		<p> Tip in the coconut milk and 150ml of water, and simmer gently for 20 minutes until the carrots have cooked through and the sauce has reduced slightly. Squeeze in the lemon juice, season lightly and sprinkle with coriander. Serve with rice and naan breads, if you like. </p>
