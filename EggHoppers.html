<h2> Ingredients </h2>
<ul>
	<li> 400ml coconut cream </li>
	<li> 20g fresh yeast, or fast-action dried yeast 7g </li>
	<li> 1 tbsp caster sugar </li>
	<li> 500g rice flour </li>
	<li> 3 egg whites </li>
	<li> for the pan vegetable oil </li>
	<li> to serve (optional) eggs </li>
</ul>

<h2> Method </h2>
<ul>
	<li> STEP 1 </li>
		<p> Stir the coconut cream, yeast and sugar in a bowl and leave in a warm spot for 45 minutes or until risen and frothy. </p>
	<li> STEP 2 </li>
		<p> Sift the rice flour into the mixture and whisk until a smooth batter forms. Cover the bowl and leave in a warm place for 3-4 hours or until the batter has doubled in size â€“ the rising time will vary considerably depending on the room temperature (the warmer, the better). Just before cooking, lightly beat the egg whites with a fork until they are foamy, then stir into the hopper mixture with 1 tsp of salt. </p>
	<li> STEP 3 </li>
		<p> Heat a hopper pan or a small non-stick frying pan over a high heat, wipe the pan lightly with oil, then pour in a 60ml ladleful of the mixture. Swirl to coat the sides of the pan, leaving a small pool of mixture in the centre. Crack in an egg (if using), then cover the pan with a lid and steam the hopper for 2-3 minutes or until the centre is firm and the sides are golden and crisp. Keep the cooked hoppers warm and repeat the process until all the batter has been used. </p>
</ul>
